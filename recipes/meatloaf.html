    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ground bison is a super alternative to ground beef. This meatloaf uses ground walnuts and diced mushrooms to act as the binder, instead of bread crumbs.
     Though the bison is not as traditional as beef, we liked it with traditional sides: mashed potatoes, green beans, and a salad.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic  </li>
        <li>2 large eggs  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste  </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste  </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).      </li>
        <li>Combine eggs, rosemary, garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Briskly stir until all ingredients are mixed together and the eggs are well blended. </li>
        <li>Add onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, and walnuts; stir to combine. Add ground bison and mix until everything is well combined.      </li>
        <li>Turn out mixture onto a 9x13-inch metal baking pan and shape into a loaf, about 9 inches long and 5 inches wide.        </li>
        <li>Place bacon strips along the length of the meatloaf and secure the ends with wooden toothpicks.    </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to sit, uncovered, about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer onto a cutting board or serving platter.     </li>
        <li>Remove toothpicks and slice into 1/2-inch slices to serve.        </li>
    </ol>
